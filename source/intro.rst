Introduction
============

This `Unix Memo  <http://unix-memo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
is composed of some notes on Unix, or mainly Linux,
administration. Some are very fragmentary, some are obsolete, or at
least not up to date, probably they contain some erroneous content, to
sum up they are unreliable.

If nevertheless you chance up over some useful content, I'm pleased
to share it. And if you want to improve the memo you are welcome
to submit a pull request in the
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/marczz/unix_memo>`_.
